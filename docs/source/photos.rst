Photo Management
****************

Google Photos is super convenient.
You can have your phone automatically upload new photos and have them available from anywhere.
I love to use it for vacations in a group: we just create a shared album, add photos and everyone has access.

Obviously, it also comes with downsides.
All your photos are on Google's servers and could be used to profile you.
Additionally, there's a cap on the amount of photos you can upload in original size.
It's tied to the storage capacity of your Google drive.
Lucky if you host your own server...

However, it's really not that easy to find a replacement for Google Photos.
These are my must-haves for a photo management software:

* auto-upload from phone
* albums without using directory structure, so that subalbums (think best-ofs) are possible without duplication
* easily share albums and photos
* low cognitive switching cost from Google Photos

Nice to have:

* show GPS data on a map
* tags
* keyboard shortcuts
* motion photo support (embedded mini videos that Pixel phones can take)
* video support

During my search I found a few promising candidates from this `list of self-hosted software  <https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#photo-and-video-galleries>`_.

* ImageStore
* LibrePhotos
* Lychee
* PiGallery2
* PhotoPrism
